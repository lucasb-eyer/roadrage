/**
 * \file Matrix.h
 * \author Pompei2
 * \date 1 February 2010
 * This file contains the definitions of some useful matrix classes. Mainly:
 *   - \a AffineMatrix A matrix that stores affine transformations (3x4: rot,scale,sheer,transl).
 *   - \a General4x4Matrix A matrix that may also store perspective projections.
 * Both matrices calculate their inverse along with every operation they are
 * used in, in order to avoid expensive inverse calculation a few hundred times
 * per frame. The inverse is needed for example for the transformation of the
 * normals.\n
 * So, if both hold their inverse, why not always use General4x4Matrix? Why does
 * AffineMatrix even exist if General4x4Matrix can do the same and more?
 *   - First, AffineMatrix also stores the inverse of its 3x3 part as if no
 *     translation had ever been done. This is useful to get the NormalMatrix.
 *   - For clarity and for you to think more about what you do.
 *   - For type safety and protecting ourselves: As soon as some projection is
 *     done, you end up with a General4x4Matrix that can't be re-transformed to
 *     an AffineMatrix and that does not store its 3x3 inverse.
 *   - AffineMatrix uses some optimizations that can not be used by General4x4Matrix.
